[![Self-Organizing](https://img.shields.io/badge/Behavior-Autonomous-green.svg)](#)

A fully integrated, reward-free AGI system featuring intrinsic motivation, high-order meta-cognition, GNN-based causal reasoning, and multi-objective decision making. Now includes upgraded world modeling (residual dynamics + Transformer mixer + CPC), EMA-based consistency learning, and concrete experimental modules.

## üöÄ What‚Äôs New (Integrated Engine)
- GNN-based Causal Reasoning Module: structure discovery, interventions (do-operator), counterfactuals, causal effect estimation ([asagi/core/causal_reasoning.py](asagi/core/causal_reasoning.py))
- Upgraded World Model: multi-scale residual dynamics + optional Transformer mixer + CPC self-supervision ([asagi/operational/world_model.py](asagi/operational/world_model.py))
- Upgraded Consistency Learner: BYOL-style EMA teacher alignment, CPC-guided ([asagi/operational/consistency_learner.py](asagi/operational/consistency_learner.py))
- Autonomous System Integrated: causal module wired in, with compute knobs ([asagi/core/autonomous_system.py](asagi/core/autonomous_system.py))
- New Demos: integrated autonomous demo and causal discovery demo in [examples/](examples)

## üèóÔ∏è Updated Architecture Overview
```
Meta-Cognition (goals, self-reflection)
        ‚Üï
Intrinsic Signal Synthesizer (dissonance, compression gain, uncertainty, novelty)
        ‚Üï
Pareto Navigator (loss-free multi-objective decisions)
        ‚Üï
Operational Layer
  - World Model (Residual + Transformer Mixer + CPC)
  - Consistency Learner (EMA Teacher Alignment)
  - Causal Reasoning (GNN): structure, do(), counterfactuals, effects
```

- Reward-free: no external reward functions, task losses, or policy objectives
- Goals emerge from intrinsic signals and meta-cognitive analysis
- Causal reasoning augments planning and analysis without scalar losses

---

## üî¨ Key Modules (Integrated)
- World Model: residual blocks, optional Transformer encoder, CPC head for self-supervised temporal consistency
- Consistency Learner: EMA teacher/student projections; alignment score used for internal coherence
- Causal Reasoning (GNN):
  - Variable extraction ‚Üí attention-style edge scoring ‚Üí directed adjacency
  - Vectorized message passing ‚Üí causal propagation
  - Interventions do(X=x), counterfactual analysis, pairwise effect estimation
- Meta-Cognition: self-reflection, knowledge gaps, autonomous goal generation
- Pareto Navigator: preference learning + constraint satisfaction without scalarization

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compute & Stability Knobs
Add these to ASAGIConfig to control cost and stability:
- causal_num_variables (default 8): increase carefully; cost ~ O(B¬∑N¬≤¬∑H)
- causal_num_layers (default 2)
- causal_hidden_dim (default 128)
- enable_causal_reasoning (default True)
- world_model_use_transformer (default True)
- world_model_depth (default 4)

Recommended for single GPU/Colab:
- N=8, layers=2, hidden=128; temperature/sparsity for adjacency; consider top-k masking for larger N.

## üö¶ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunghunkwag/Autonomous-Self-Organizing-AGI.git
cd Autonomous-Self-Organizing-AGI
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### Integrated Autonomous Demo
```bash
python examples/basic_autonomous_operation.py
```
Shows: intrinsic motivation (no rewards), upgraded world model (CPC), EMA consistency, GNN causal reasoning, Pareto navigation, emergent skills.

### Causal Discovery Demo
```bash
python examples/causal_discovery_demo.py
```
Shows: structure discovery, intervention simulation, counterfactual reasoning, and simple structure matching analysis.

## üß† Reward-Free Principles (Unchanged)
- No external rewards or loss functions
- Goals emerge from intrinsic signals: predictive dissonance, compression gains, uncertainty reduction, novelty topology
- Multi-objective decision making without scalarization (Pareto frontier navigation)

## üìä Metrics & Logging
- Autonomous Operation Summary: motivation, coherence, autonomy, causal discoveries
- Causal Graph Sparsity: [0,1] ‚Äî monitor stability (ideal ~0.2‚Äì0.6)
- CPC Signal & Consistency Score: self-supervised learning health

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes on Scaling
- Compute grows with number of causal variables; keep N modest on small GPUs
- Use sparsity/temperature controls; add top‚Äëk masking for larger graphs
- All components are batched and vectorized for GPU parallelism
